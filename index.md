# About
I am a first-year PhD student at Stanford University. I recently completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at University of Toronto under supervision by Dr. [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/) in the [CleverHans Lab](https://cleverhans-lab.github.io/) and Dr. [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) in the [HealthyML lab](https://healthyml.org/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from University of Southern California, with minors in Chemistry and Computer Science.

Through the past several years, my research interests have spanned statistical learning theory; algorithmic fairness and equity in machine learning; differential privacy; representation learning; optimization; and generalizable applications of machine learning in the healthcare and biological domains. At the moment, I continue to be motivated by a broad range of topics and research questions under the general umbrella of mathematics and machine learning.
