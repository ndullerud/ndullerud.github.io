# About
I am a fourth year PhD student at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Sanmi Koyejo](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/members/sanmi_koyejo.html) in the [STAIR Lab](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/). Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at University of Toronto under supervision by Prof. [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/) in the [CleverHans Lab](https://cleverhans-lab.github.io/) and Prof. [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) in the [HealthyML lab](https://healthyml.org/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from University of Southern California, with minors in Chemistry and Computer Science.

Through the past several years, my research interests have spanned causality; statistical learning theory; representation learning; optimization; algorithmic fairness and equity in machine learning; differential privacy; and generalizable applications of machine learning in the healthcare and biological domains. I continue to be motivated by a broad range of topics and research questions under the general umbrella of mathematics and statistical learning.
